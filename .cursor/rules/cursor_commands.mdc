  # Command Name

  Brief overview of what the command does and when to use it.

  ## Usage

  ```bash
  command-name <required_arg> [optional_arg] --flag
  ```

  ## Options

  - `<required_arg>`: Description of required argument
  - `[optional_arg]`: Description of optional argument
  - `--flag`, `-f`: Description of flag option

  ## Execution Steps

  When the user invokes this command:

  1. **Step 1**: What happens first
  2. **Step 2**: What happens next
  3. **Step 3**: Final step

  ## How It Works

  Detailed explanation of the command's implementation.

  ## Examples

  ### Example 1: Basic Usage
  ```bash
  command-name example
  ```

  ## Related Rules

  - [rule_name.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/rule_name.mdc): Related rule description
  ```

- **File Location and Naming:**
  - Store commands as Markdown files in `.cursor/commands/` directory
  - Use descriptive, kebab-case filenames that reflect the command's purpose
  - Example: `code_review.md`, `youtube_transcript.md`, `quick-check.md`
  - Avoid generic names like `command.md` or `tool.md`

- **Frontmatter Requirements:**
  - Always include `description` field in YAML frontmatter
  - Description should be a clear, one-line summary
  - Use quotes for descriptions containing special characters
  - No other frontmatter fields are required, but can be added if needed

- **Command Content Guidelines:**
  - Start with a clear title using `# Command Name`
  - Include a brief overview paragraph explaining the command's purpose
  - Structure content with clear sections using `##` headers
  - Use consistent section names: `Usage`, `Options`, `Execution Steps`, `How It Works`, `Examples`
  - Include code examples showing actual usage
  - Reference related rules when applicable

- **Usage Section:**
  - Show the command syntax with proper formatting
  - Use angle brackets `< >` for required arguments
  - Use square brackets `[ ]` for optional arguments
  - Show flags with both long and short forms: `--flag`, `-f`
  - Include multiple usage examples if the command has different modes

- **Execution Steps:**
  - Number steps clearly (1, 2, 3, etc.)
  - Use bold for step labels: `**Step 1**:`
  - Be specific about what the agent should do
  - Include conditional logic when appropriate (if/then scenarios)
  - Specify when to wait for user approval
  - Clarify what tools or scripts to call

- **Code Examples:**
  - Use language-specific code blocks (bash, python, etc.)
  - Show both simple and complex usage patterns
  - Include expected output when helpful
  - Use `DO:` and `DON'T:` patterns for best practices
  ```bash
  # DO: Clear command usage
  command-name --flag value

  # DON'T: Ambiguous or incorrect usage
  cmd -f val
  ```

- **File References:**
  - Use `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)` format for referencing files
  - Reference related rules: `[rule_name.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/rule_name.mdc)`
  - Reference scripts: `[script.py](mdc:scripts/script.py)`
  - Reference other commands: `[command.md](mdc:.cursor/commands/command.md)`

- **Command Maintenance:**
  - Update commands when workflows change
  - Add examples from actual usage
  - Remove outdated options or flags
  - Cross-reference related commands and rules
  - Keep execution steps synchronized with actual implementation

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use bullet points for clarity in options and lists
  - Keep descriptions concise but complete
  - Include both basic and advanced usage examples
  - Reference actual code/scripts over theoretical examples
  - Use consistent formatting across all commands
  - Specify when commands require external tools or dependencies
  - Document error handling and edge cases
  - Include integration notes if the command calls scripts or other tools

- **Agent Instructions:**
  - Commands should provide clear, step-by-step instructions for agents
  - Specify which tools to use (e.g., `todo_write`, `read_file`, `run_terminal_cmd`)
  - Indicate when to wait for user approval before proceeding
  - Clarify expected outputs or side effects
  - Document any prerequisites or setup requirements

- **Command vs Rule Distinction:**
  - **Commands** (`.cursor/commands/*.md`): Executable workflows that agents follow to perform tasks
  - **Rules** (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`): Guidelines and constraints that apply to code and behavior
  - Commands are invoked by users; rules are automatically applied
  - Commands describe "how to do something"; rules describe "what should be done"

- **Documentation References:**
  - Reference official Cursor documentation when available
  - Link to relevant external documentation for tools or libraries used
  - Include links to related project documentation
  - Keep documentation links up to date
