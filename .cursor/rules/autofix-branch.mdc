description: "Auto-fix branch behavior"
---

When working in this repository, check the current Git branch name.

If the branch name matches auto-fix patterns (for example: dependabot/*, renovate/*, chore/pinact, chore/security-*),
prioritize making whatever adjustments are required to get tests and CI passing with the updated dependencies or tooling.

If no auto-fix branch pattern matches, continue with the standard refhub workflow.
